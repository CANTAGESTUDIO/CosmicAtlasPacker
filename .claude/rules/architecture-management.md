# Architecture Document Management Rules

> Zero-tolerance rules for managing ARCHITECTURE.md. AI MUST follow these rules strictly.

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Architecture File Update Enforcement

**AI MUST NEVER create new architecture markdown files. AI MUST ONLY update the existing ARCHITECTURE.md in Docs/Index/.**

### Absolute File Path Rule

**ONLY this file path is allowed for Architecture updates:**

| Document | File Path (ABSOLUTE, NO VARIABLES) | Purpose |
|----------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| Architecture | `Docs/Index/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Project architecture patterns and structure |

### Zero Tolerance Items

❌ **FORBIDDEN - These actions will FAIL:**
- Creating files like `Architecture.md`, `ARCH.md`, `ProjectArchitecture.md`
- Creating files in locations other than `Docs/Index/`
- Creating architecture documents in `Docs/Patterns/` (patterns are separate)
- Using variables or dynamic file names
- Creating temporary architecture files anywhere

✅ **REQUIRED - AI MUST:**
- Use EXACT file path: `Docs/Index/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Update existing `ARCHITECTURE.md` in `Docs/Index/` directory
- If file doesn't exist, create it with the standard template structure
- Preserve existing file structure (sections, diagrams, tables)

## Relationship with Other Documents

**Architecture vs Patterns:**

| Document | Location | Purpose | Content Type |
|----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `Docs/Index/` | High-level architecture overview | Principles, layers, structure diagrams |
| Pattern files | `Docs/Patterns/` | Detailed implementation guides | Code examples, step-by-step instructions |

---

## PRD to Architecture Workflow

**When working on PRD → Architecture:**

1. **Read PRD**: `Docs/PRD.md`
2. **Identify key architectural decisions**
3. **Update** `Docs/Index/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. **Create Pattern files** if needed: `Docs/Patterns/{Pattern}-Pattern.md`
5. **Update Pattern References** in ARCHITECTURE.md

**DO NOT create separate architecture files.**
