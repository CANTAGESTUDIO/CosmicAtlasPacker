# History System

> History system that AI must log whenever a Task/SubTask is completed.

## Logging Rules

**AI MUST log to History whenever a Task/SubTask is completed.**

**Logging Location:** `Docs/History/History_yyMMdd.md`

## Logging Format

| Time | Task Title | Retrospective |
|------|------------|---------------|
| HH:mm | Completed task title | Summary of work and results |

## Rules

1. Log immediately to the corresponding date's History file when Task or SubTask is completed
2. Retrospective should briefly describe work content, changes, and notable points
3. If History file doesn't exist, create it automatically before logging

## Example

| Time | Task Title | Retrospective |
|------|------------|---------------|
| 14:30 | Implement login feature | Added JWT authentication, completed token refresh logic |
| 15:45 | Write API documentation | Swagger integration, documented 20 endpoints |
