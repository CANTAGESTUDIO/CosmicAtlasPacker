# Motion

> Animation principles, timing functions, and transition guidelines.

## Motion Principles

1. **Purposeful**: Animation should guide, not distract
2. **Swift**: Keep animations fast and responsive
3. **Natural**: Use easing that mimics real-world physics
4. **Consistent**: Same actions should have same animations

## Duration Scale

| Token | Duration | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `duration-instant` | 0ms | Immediate feedback |
| `duration-fast` | 100ms | Micro-interactions |
| `duration-normal` | 200ms | Default transitions |
| `duration-slow` | 300ms | Complex animations |
| `duration-slower` | 400ms | Page transitions |
| `duration-slowest` | 500ms | Elaborate effects |

## Easing Functions

| Token | Curve | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `ease-linear` | linear | Progress bars |
| `ease-in` | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1) | Exit animations |
| `ease-out` | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1) | Enter animations |
| `ease-in-out` | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) | General transitions |
| `ease-spring` | spring(1, 100, 10, 0) | Bouncy effects |

## Common Animations

### Fade

```swift
.opacity(0) → .opacity(1)
Duration: 200ms
Easing: ease-out
```

### Scale

```swift
.scaleEffect(0.95) → .scaleEffect(1)
Duration: 200ms
Easing: ease-out
```

### Slide

```swift
.offset(x: -20) → .offset(x: 0)
Duration: 250ms
Easing: ease-out
```

## State Transitions

| Transition | Duration | Easing |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Hover | 100ms | ease-out |
| Focus | 150ms | ease-out |
| Active | 50ms | ease-in |
| Disabled | 200ms | ease-in-out |

## Page Transitions

| Type | Duration | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| Push | 300ms | Slide left + fade |
| Pop | 300ms | Slide right + fade |
| Modal Present | 300ms | Slide up + fade |
| Modal Dismiss | 250ms | Slide down + fade |

## Guidelines

### Do's ✅

- Keep most animations under 300ms
- Use spring animations for playful interactions
- Animate properties that are GPU-accelerated (opacity, transform)
- Reduce motion for accessibility when requested

### Don'ts ❌

- Don't animate layout properties (width, height, top, left)
- Don't use delays longer than 100ms for feedback
- Don't chain more than 2 sequential animations
- Don't animate on scroll without throttling
